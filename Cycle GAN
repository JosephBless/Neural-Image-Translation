Cycle GAN Training
This script is used to define the Cycle GAN class, train the two Generative Adversarial Networks, generate samples, and save the model at every epoch interval.

User Specified Parameters:
batch_size: Integer representing how many images to train per batch.
dataset_dimensions: Tuple defining dimensions to resize the dataset to during preprocessing.
dataset_name : String representing name of Tensorflow Dataset (e.g. cycle_gan/apple2orange). Only needs to be defined if preprocessed_dataset is True.
input_img_size: Tuple defining the size of the random crops to be used during training.
input_path: File path pointing to folder containing input dataset. Only needs to be defined if preprocessed_dataset is False.
interval: Integer representing how many epochs between saving your model.
model_save_path: File path pointing to the folder where you want to save to model as well as generated samples.
output_path: File path pointing to folder containing output dataset. Only needs to be defined if preprocessed_dataset is False.
pretrain: Boolean flag for if you want to train starting with a pretrained model.
pretrained_model_path: File path pointing to pretrained H5 model if pretraining mode is enabled.
preprocessed_dataset: Boolean flag for if you want to train with a preprocessed Tensorflow Dataset.
training_epochs: Integer representing how many epochs to train the model.
Cycle GAN Inference
This script is used to test trained Cycle GAN models and plot results.

User Specified Parameters:
dataset_dimensions: Tuple defining dimensions to resize the dataset to during preprocessing.
dataset_name : String representing name of Tensorflow Dataset (e.g. cycle_gan/horse2zebra). Only needs to be defined if preprocessed_dataset is True.
input_path: File path pointing to folder containing input dataset. Only needs to be defined if preprocessed_dataset is False.
model_path: File path pointing to H5 model saved during training process.
output_path: File path pointing to folder containing output dataset. Only needs to be defined if preprocessed_dataset is False.
preprocessed_dataset: Boolean flag for if you want to train with a preprocessed Tensorflow Dataset.
results_save_path: File path pointing to folder where generated results are saved.
